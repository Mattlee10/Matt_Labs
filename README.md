## Q2'25 Labs #01 - How much did my day change jsut by walking to and from work?

### Overview
This is a self-traking experiment using Apple Watch data, designed to understand how daily commuting walks (10-30 minutes) affect overall NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis).

The goal is to quantify low-intensity activity by calculating how long I stayed in the 10-30% Karvonen heart rate zone each day.

### Hypothesis
If I maintain a daily commuting walk of 10-30 minutes,
then the percentage of time I spend in the Karvonen 10-30% intensity zone will increase.
